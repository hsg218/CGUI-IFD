* Parameters generated by analogy by
* CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) program version 2.5.1
*

! Penalties lower than 10 indicate the analogy is fair; penalties between 10
! and 50 mean some basic validation is recommended; penalties higher than
! 50 indicate poor analogy and mandate extensive validation/optimization.
